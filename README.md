# 2C

The code for the structure of 2C is heavily re-used from my 2B site. Thus, the following credits are necessary: 

To assist in the development and refinement of this web page, I utilized AI tools to enhance productivity and accuracy in the html code. ChatGPT provided real-time assistance, helping to refine the logic, troubleshoot issues, and ensure semantic correctness in the code structure. Meanwhile, GitHub Copilot served as a helpful coding partner, suggesting completions and snippets based on context, which greatly accelerated the development process. These AI-powered tools have proven invaluable, not only in speeding up development but also in improving the quality of the code, making it more robust and maintainable.

Additionally, I have continued using W3 Schools to assist in the development of my html skills and knowledge.
